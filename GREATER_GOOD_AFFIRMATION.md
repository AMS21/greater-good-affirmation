# The Greater Good Affirmation, Version 1.0.x

As a representative of an open source project or group, I affirm that the community to which I belong makes a best effort to exist *for the greater good.* Specifically, this means that:

 - The project or group that I represent has honorable intentions, meaning doing something that is primarily intended to benefit many people, or a community over any self-interest.
 - The project grew to be valued for its own utility by users and/or developers external to itself without influence of artificial means, or unfair advantage.
 - Effort is made to ensure that licensing, funding, and communication are transparent.
 - The project or group strives to do no harm.


## Transparency for an open source project means:

 - Any direct or indirect profits from the software as a result of the project, community, or supporting company providing a product or services are [disclosed](https://github.com/good-labs/FUNDING.md). 
 - Documentation and templates for [contributing](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) are provided to support community participation.

I make this affirmation in good faith, and am free to withdraw my participation at any time.
