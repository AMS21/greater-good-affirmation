# The Greater Good Pledge, Version 1.0.x

As a representative of an open source project or group, I affirm that the community 
to which I belong practices transparency, and makes a best effort to exist 
*for the greater good*.  Specifically, this means that:

 - Any direct or indirect profits from the software as a result of the project, community, or supporting company providing a product or services are disclosed in a [FUNDING.md](https://good-labs.github.io/docs/projects/funding/). 
 - The majority of contributors represent dispersed community (and not required participants for a company).
 - The community strives for open communication for discussion around development.
 - Software is provided under an open source license, with no private distributions or versions with special privileges (no "open core" models).

## Projects are encouraged to:

 - Describe in [FUNDING.yml](https://www.github.com/good-labs/FUNDING.md) file on how financial assistance to the project and its maintainers could be provided if needed or desired
 - Include documentation and a CONTRIBUTING.md file to encourage participation.
 - Include information about communication channels (chats, videos, etc) and typical meeting venues (user group meetings, conferences, etc).

By participating in this pledge, I can confirm that my community is in spirit of being "for the greater good."  I take this pledge in good faith, and am free to withdraw my participation at any time.
