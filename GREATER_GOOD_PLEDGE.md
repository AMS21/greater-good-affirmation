# The Greater Good Pledge

As a representative of an open source project or group, I affirm that
the community to which I belong practices transparency, and exists
*for the greater good*. Specifically, this means that:

 - The software that is being provided open source by a company cannot directly or indirectly contribute to making profits for that company.
 - The majority of contributors represent dispersed community (and not required participants for a company)
 - The community strives for open communication for discussion around development.
 - All software is provided under an open source license, with no private distributions or versions with special privileges.

By taking this pledge, I am committing to a continued effort to maintain this
transparency of communication, and incentives. I affirm that
the open source project or community that I represent exists for the
greater good.
