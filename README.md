This is an effort to encourage transparency in open source software.
Projects that take the Greater Good Affirmation affirm that there are no
ulterior motives, and that communication and incentives are transparent.
By taking the [Greater Good Affirmation](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation/), 
a community affirms that it provides software under a traditional
open source model, and exists non-selfishly to solve problems toward the
greater good.

### How do I participate?

We are actively working on the first draft of the affirmation, please make suggestions
or comments to the document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtU-g5NpAb8K-tNrG8P0KMwRO44iLETLRPbuBFiyUts/edit).
The (live) version on the site is updated regularly after conversation with changes,
and when discussion dies down the first (official) release will go out.

Participation comes down to [reading the affirmation](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation), 
and then adding the Greater Good Affirmation badge to your repository. Participation
is done on good faith. The presence of the badge in your GitHub projects affirms
that you are working for the greater good.
