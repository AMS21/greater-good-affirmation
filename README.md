This is an effort to encourage transparency in open source software.
Projects that take the Greater Good Pledge affirm that there are no
ulterior motives, and that communication and incentives are transparent.
By taking the [Greater Good Pledge](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-pledge/), 
a community affirms that it provides software under a traditional
open source model, and exists non-selfishly to solve problems for users and
not make profits off of them.

### How do I participate?

We are actively working on the first draft of the pledge, please make suggestions
or comments to the document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KtU-g5NpAb8K-tNrG8P0KMwRO44iLETLRPbuBFiyUts/edit).
The (live) version on the site is updated regularly after conversation with changes,
and when discussion dies down the first (official) release will go out.
